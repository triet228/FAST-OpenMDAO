# FAST OpenMDAO

FAST OpenMDAO is the OpenMDAO integration layer for **Future Aircraft Sizing
Tool (FAST)** by The IDEAS Lab in the Aerospace Engineering Department at the
University of Michigan.

The goal is to turn the native `FAST-Python` workflow into a gradient-based
aircraft sizing framework. This repository will hold OpenMDAO components,
groups, derivative checks, and optimization examples while keeping
`FAST-Python` as the source of the FAST equations and data model.

## Current Status

This repository is in initial setup. The first milestone is a clean Python
package with project metadata, tests, and installation instructions. OpenMDAO
model components will be added in small commits after this scaffold.

## Repository Layout

```text
FAST-OpenMDAO/
  src/fast_openmdao/     Python package for OpenMDAO integration
  tests/                 Unit and smoke tests
  README.md              Project overview and setup notes
  pyproject.toml         Package metadata and test configuration
```

## Local Setup

Use Python 3.11 so the environment matches `FAST-Python`.

```powershell
conda create -n FAST-OpenMDAO python=3.11 -y
conda activate FAST-OpenMDAO
python -m pip install -e C:\Users\homin\Projects\FAST-Python
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

If Conda resolves that name to an unwritable system prefix, create and activate
the user-local path explicitly:

```powershell
conda create -p C:\Users\homin\.conda\envs\FAST-OpenMDAO python=3.11 -y
conda activate C:\Users\homin\.conda\envs\FAST-OpenMDAO
python -m pip install -e C:\Users\homin\Projects\FAST-Python
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

If the environment already exists, activate it and run the two install commands
again to refresh editable installs.

## Validate

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
```

## Development Roadmap

1. Add a minimal OpenMDAO component that wraps a `FAST-Python` case.
2. Expose scalar FAST inputs as OpenMDAO design variables.
3. Add finite-difference and complex-step derivative checks where supported.
4. Build reusable groups for mission, propulsion, weights, and objective
   functions.
5. Add optimization examples that run from the command line.
